## 解释
1. 汉隆的剃刀（Hanlon's razor）是一句来自Robert J. Hanlon的谚语：“在用愚蠢足以解释的情况下，请不要用恶意推测别人”。罗伯特·海莱因在1941年发表的小说《帝国的逻辑》中有句话：“你把愚蠢所导致的许多情况，都归咎于邪恶”。有个谚语，一般认为是出自拿破仑一世：“如果无能已经足以充分解释，就绝不要归咎于恶意。”歌德在1774年发表的名作《少年维特的烦恼》中也有句类似的话：“误解和忽视在世上所造成的混乱，比恶意和欺骗要多上许多。无论如何，后两者的频率都低得多”。相关理论：(基本归因错误)[https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%BD%92%E5%9B%A0%E9%94%99%E8%AF%AF]
2. 奥卡姆剃刀(Occam’s Razor)又称“奥坎的剃刀”，拉丁文为lex parsimoniae，意思是简约之法则，是由14世纪逻辑学家、圣方济各会修士奥卡姆的威廉（William of Occam，约1287年至1347年，奥卡姆（Ockham）位于英格兰的萨里郡）提出的一个解决问题的法则，他在《箴言书注》2卷15题说“切勿浪费较多东西，去做‘用较少的东西，同样可以做好的事情’。”换一种说法，如果关于同一个问题有许多种理论，每一种都能作出同样准确的预言，那么应该挑选其中使用假定最少的。尽管越复杂的方法通常能做出越好的预言，但是在不考虑预言能力（即结果大致相同）的情况下，假设越少越好。所罗门诺夫的归纳推理理论是奥卡姆剃刀的数学公式化：在所有能够完美描述已有观测的可计算理论中，较短的可计算理论在估计下一次观测结果的概率时具有较大权重。在自然科学中，奥卡姆剃刀被作为启发法技巧来使用，更多地作为帮助科学家发展理论模型的工具，而不是在已经发表的理论之间充当裁判角色。在科学方法中，奥卡姆剃刀并没有被当做逻辑上不可辩驳的定理或者科学结论。在科学方法中对简单性的偏好，是基于可证伪性的标准。对于某个现象的所有可接受的解释，都存在无数个可能的、更为复杂的变体：因为你可以把任何解释中的错误归结于特例假设，从而避免该错误的发生。所以，较简单的理论比复杂的理论更好，因为它们更加可检验。相关理论：(合区谬误)[https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%88%E5%8F%96%E8%B0%AC%E8%AF%AF]，又称为交集偏误、连言偏误，是认为多重条件“甲且乙”比单一条件“甲”更可能发生的认知偏误，也是一种机率谬误,当你听到马蹄声，要首先想到马，而不是鹿。

(1) Occam’s Razor — “Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.” (related: conjunction fallacy, overfitting, “when you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.”)
(1) Cognitive Biases — “Tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality or good judgments.” (See list of cognitive biases)
(1) Arguing from First Principles — “A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption.” (related: dimensionality reduction; orthogonality; “Reasonable minds can disagree” if underlying premises differ.)
(1) Proximate vs Root Cause — “A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the ‘real’ reason something occurred.” (related: 5 whys — “to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question ‘Why?’)
Modeling
(1) Thought Experiment — “considers some hypothesis, theory, or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences.” (related: counterfactual thinking)
(1) Systems Thinking — “By taking the overall system as well as its parts into account systems thinking is designed to avoid potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences.” (related: causal loop diagrams; stock and flow; Le Chatelier’s principle, hysteresis — “the time-based dependence of a system’s output on present and past inputs.”; “Can’t see the forest for the trees.”)
(1) Scenario Analysis — “A process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes.” (related: “Skate to where the puck is going.”; black swan theory — “a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight.”)
(1) Power-law — “A functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.” (related: Pareto distribution; Pareto principle — “for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.”, diminishing returns, premature optimization, heavy-tailed distribution, fat-tailed distribution; long tail — “the portion of the distribution having a large number of occurrences far from the “head” or central part of the distribution.”; black swan theory — “a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight.”)
(1) Normal Distribution — “A very common continuous probability distribution…Physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes (such as measurement errors) often have distributions that are nearly normal.” (related: central limit theorem)
(1) Sensitivity Analysis — “The study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs.”
(1) Cost-benefit Analysis — “A systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives that satisfy transactions, activities or functional requirements for a business.” (related: net present value — “a measurement of the profitability of an undertaking that is calculated by subtracting the present values of cash outflows (including initial cost) from the present values of cash inflows over a period of time.”, discount rate)
(3) Simulation — “The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.” (related: Queuing theory — “the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues.”)
(3) Pareto Efficiency — “A state of allocation of resources in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off…A Pareto improvement is defined to be a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off, given a certain initial allocation of goods among a set of individuals.”
Physics
(2) Critical Mass — “The smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.” “In social dynamics, critical mass is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth.”
(2) Activation Energy — “The minimum energy which must be available to a chemical system with potential reactants to result in a chemical reaction.”
(2) Catalyst — “A substance which increases the rate of a chemical reaction.” (related: tipping point)
(2) Leverage — “The force amplification achieved by using a tool, mechanical device or machine system.” (related: Theory of constraints — “a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints.”
(2) Inertia — “the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of motion; this includes changes to its speed, direction or state of rest. It is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity.” (related: strategy tax — “sometimes products developed inside a company…have to accept constraints that go against competitiveness, or might displease users, in order to further the cause of another product.”; flywheel — “a rotating mechanical device that is used to store rotational energy. Flywheels have an inertia called the moment of inertia and thus resist changes in rotational speed.”)
(2) Half-life — “the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value. The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, radioactive decay.” (related: viral marketing)
(3) Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle — “A fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known.”
Brainstorming
(1) Lateral Thinking — “Solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic.”
(1) Divergent Thinking vs Convergent Thinking — “Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. It is often used in conjunction with its cognitive opposite, convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a ‘correct’ solution.” (related: groupthink; Maslow’s hammer — “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”)
(2) Crowdsourcing — “The process of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, especially an online community, rather than from employees or suppliers.” (related: wisdom of the crowd — “a large group’s aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, and often better than, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group.”; collective intelligence; bandwagon effect — “a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases the more that they have already been adopted by others.”; Stone Soup)
(2) Paradigm shift — “a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline.” (related: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions — “An episodic model in which periods of such conceptual continuity in normal science were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science; Planck’s principle — “the view that scientific change does not occur because individual scientists change their mind, but rather that successive generations of scientists have different views.”; punctuated equilibrium)
Experimenting
(1) Scientific Method — “Systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.” (related: reproducibility)
(1) Proxy — “A variable that is not in itself directly relevant, but that serves in place of an unobservable or immeasurable variable. In order for a variable to be a good proxy, it must have a close correlation, not necessarily linear, with the variable of interest.” (related: revealed preference; Proxy War — “A conflict between two nations where neither country directly engages the other.”)
(1) Selection Bias — “The selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed.” (related: sampling bias)
(1) Response Bias — “A wide range of cognitive biases that influence the responses of participants away from an accurate or truthful response.”
(2) Observer Effect — “Changes that the act of observation will make on a phenomenon being observed.” (related: Schrödinger’s cat)
(2) Survivorship Bias — “The logical error of concentrating on the people or things that ‘survived’ some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility.”
Interpreting
(1) Order of Magnitude — “An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten.” (related: order of approximation, back-of-the-envelope calculation, dimensional analysis, Fermi problem)
(1) Major vs Minor Factors — Major factors explains major portions of the results, while minor factors only explain minor portions. (related: first order vs second order effects — first order effects directly follow from a cause, while second order effects follow from first order effects.)
(1) False Positives and False Negatives — “A false positive error, or in short false positive, commonly called a ‘false alarm’, is a result that indicates a given condition has been fulfilled, when it actually has not been fulfilled…A false negative error, or in short false negative, is where a test result indicates that a condition failed, while it actually was successful, i.e. erroneously no effect has been assumed.”
(1) Confidence Interval — “Confidence intervals consist of a range of values (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter; however, the interval computed from a particular sample does not necessarily include the true value of the parameter.” (related: error bar)
(2) Bayes’ Theorem — “Describes the probability of an event, based on conditions that might be related to the event. For example, suppose one is interested in whether a person has cancer, and knows the person’s age. If cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes’ theorem, information about the person’s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer.” (related: base rate fallacy)
(2) Regression to the Mean — “The phenomenon that if a variable is extreme on its first measurement, it will tend to be closer to the average on its second measurement.” (related: Pendulum swing; variance; Gambler’s fallacy)
(2) Inflection Point — “A point on a curve at which the curve changes from being concave (concave downward) to convex (concave upward), or vice versa.”
(3) Simpson’s Paradox — “A paradox in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.”
Deciding
(1) Business Case — “Captures the reasoning for initiating a project or task. It is often presented in a well-structured written document, but may also sometimes come in the form of a short verbal argument or presentation.” (related: why this now?)
(1) Opportunity Cost — “The value of the best alternative forgone where, given limited resources, a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives. Assuming the best choice is made, it is the ‘cost’ incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice.” (related: cost of capital)
(1) Intuition — Personal experience coded into your personal neural network, which means your intuition is dangerous outside the bounds of your personal experience. (related: thinking fast vs thinking slow — “a dichotomy between two modes of thought: ‘System 1’ is fast, instinctive and emotional; ‘System 2’ is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.”)
(1) Local vs Global Optimum — “A local optimum of an optimization problem is a solution that is optimal (either maximal or minimal) within a neighboring set of candidate solutions. This is in contrast to a global optimum, which is the optimal solution among all possible solutions, not just those in a particular neighborhood of values.”
(1) Decision Trees — “A decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.” (related: expected value)
(1) Sunk Cost — “A cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered.” (related: “throwing good money after bad”, “in for a penny, in for a pound”)
(1) Availability Bias — “People tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.”
(1) Confirmation Bias — “The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities.” (related: cognitive dissonance)
(3) Loss Aversion — “People’s tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains.” (related: diminishing marginal utility)
Reasoning
(1) Anecdotal — “Using a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence.”
(1) False Cause — “Presuming that a real or perceived relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other.” (related: correlation does not imply causation, or in xkcd form)
(1) Straw Man — “Giving the impression of refuting an opponent’s argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent.”
(1) Plausible — Thinking that just because something is plausible means that it is true.
(1) Likely — Thinking that just because something is possible means that it is likely.
(1) Appeal to Emotion — “Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument.”
(1) Ad Hominem — “Attacking your opponent’s character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.”
(1) Slippery Slope — “Asserting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will eventually happen too, therefore A should not happen.” (related: broken windows theory — “maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.”)
(1) Black or White — “When two alternative states are presented as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.”
(1) Bandwagon — “Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.”
For a longer list, see Thou shall not commit logical fallacies (I have this poster on my office door.)
Negotiating
(1) The Third Story — “The Third Story is one an impartial observer, such as a mediator, would tell; it’s a version of events both sides can agree on.” (related: Most Respectful Interpretation)
(1) Active Listening — “Requires that the listener fully concentrates, understands, responds and then remembers what is being said.”
(1) Trade-offs — “A situation that involves losing one quality or aspect of something in return for gaining another quality or aspect.”
(1) Incentives — “Something that motivates an individual to perform an action.” (related: carrot and stick — “a policy of offering a combination of rewards and punishment to induce behavior.”)
(2) Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) — “The most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached.”
(2) Zero-sum vs Non-zero-sum — “A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant’s gain (or loss) of utility is exactly balanced by the losses (or gains) of the utility of the other participant(s)…In contrast, non-zero-sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties’ aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero.” (related: win-win — “A win–win strategy is a conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all disputants.”)
(3) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) — “Dispute resolution processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of litigation.” (related: mediation; arbitration; “extend an olive branch.”)
(3) Prisoner’s Dilemma — “A standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely ‘rational’ individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.” (related: Nash equilibrium, evolutionarily stable strategy)
Mitigating
(1) Unintended Consequences — “Outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action.” (related: collateral damage — “Deaths, injuries, or other damage inflicted on an unintended target.”, Goodhart’s law — “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”; Campbell’s law; Streisand Effect — “The phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet”; cobra effect — “when an attempted solution to a problem actually makes the problem worse.”; “Kick a hornet’s nest.”)
(2) Preserving Optionality — “A strategy of keeping options open and fluid, fighting the urge to make choices too soon, before all of the uncertainties have been resolved.” (related: tyranny of small decisions — “a situation where a series of small, individually rational decisions can negatively change the context of subsequent choices, even to the point where desired alternatives are irreversibly destroyed.”; boiling frog — “an anecdote describing a frog slowly being boiled alive.”; path dependence; “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”; fog of war; OODA loop)
(2) Precautionary Principle — “If an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public, or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus (that the action or policy is not harmful), the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action that may or may not be a risk.”
(2) Short-termism — “Short-termism refers to an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests.”
Managing
(1) Weekly 1–1s — “1–1’s can add a whole new level of speed and agility to your company.”
(1) Forcing Function — “A forcing function is any task, activity or event that forces you to take action and produce a result.”
(1) Directly Responsible Individual — A management concept, originally championed by Apple, that good things come if someone is explicitly responsible for something. (related: diffusion of responsibility — “a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when others are present.”; bystander effect — “a social psychological phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present.”)
(1) Pygmalion Effect — “The phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an increase in performance.” (related: market pull technology policy — where the government sets future standards beyond what the current market can deliver, and the market pulls that technology into existence.; Radical Candor)
(1) Virtual Team — “A group of individuals who work across time, space and organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication technology.” At least in some circumstances, it is possible to have a completely virtual team. The downsides in lack of face-to-face communication can be outweighed by the upsides in sourcing from the entire world.
(2) Introversion vs Extraversion — “Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms.”
(2) IQ vs EQ — “IQ is a total score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence.” “EQ is the capacity of individuals to recognize their own, and other people’s emotions, to discriminate between different feelings and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior.”
(2) Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset — “Those with a ‘fixed mindset’ believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities, while those with a ‘growth mindset’ believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study.”
(2) Hindsight Bias — “The inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it.” (related: Pollyanna principle — “tendency for people to remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones”)
(2) Organizational Debt — “All the people/culture compromises made to ‘just get it done’ in the early stages of a startup.”
(2) Generalist vs Specialist — “A generalist is a person with a wide array of knowledge, the opposite of which is a specialist.” (related: hedgehog vs fox — “A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing.”)
(2) Consequence vs Conviction — “Where there is low consequence and you have very low confidence in your own opinion, you should absolutely delegate. And delegate completely, let people make mistakes and learn. On the other side, obviously where the consequences are dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you are right, you actually can’t let your junior colleague make a mistake.”
(3) High-context vs Low-context Culture — “In a higher-context culture, many things are left unsaid, letting the culture explain. Words and word choice become very important in higher-context communication, since a few words can communicate a complex message very effectively to an in-group (but less effectively outside that group), while in a low-context culture, the communicator needs to be much more explicit and the value of a single word is less important.”
(3) Peter Principle — “The selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate’s performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role.
